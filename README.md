# Computer-Vision-Based-Text-Scanner
Develop a computer vision-based text scanner that can scan any text from an image using the optical character recognition algorithm and display the text on your screen.This project, intend to help by providing their user with visual recognition of various text and images. In this project, we discuss a system that uses existing technologies such as the Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and use it to automatically identify and recognize texts and signs in the environment and help the users. The challenge of extracting text from images of documents has traditionally been referred to as Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and has been the focus of much research
